This project aims to predict property prices using the properties' textual overview for enhanced accuracy

## Runnable files
- **zero_shot.py**: Runs a zero shot evaluation on pre trained models and saves the results to a file
- **fine_tuning.py**: Runs a fine tuning process with our training data. print the evaluation results thoughtout the process but doesn't save anything
- **evaluate_models.py**: Fine tunes each of the pre-defined models and evaluates the fine-tuned models on out test data. The statistics are saved to a results file at the end of the process.
