{"price":"$365,000","bed":"2","bath":"1","sqft":"1,268","address":"2129 NW Northrup St APT 1,Â Portland, OR 97210","overview":"One of the few remaining relics of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, or the 1905 World's Fair, as some called it. Located on the main floor, this south facing unit sits high off the street and offers an abundance of light and architectural beauty! High ceilings showcase original detailing like picture rails and built-in buffet and butler's pantry. Entertaining is fun with the large formal dining room, which abuts the living room. Brand new vinyl windows and window coverings allow for ample privacy and ultimate noise reduction from the lively neighborhood, and this is the only unit that has forced air heat! Relax in the peace & quiet this condo has to offer, or step out the front door and access one of the most vibrant neighborhoods Portland has to offer. There are multiple eateries, shops, parks and cafes within a block or two, or hop on the streetcar, with the closest stop less than a block away! Secure storage in huge high ceiling basement, with community laundry room. You will love living here!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/945f090c2ffdec669287778af1b53d19-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://my.matterport.com/api/v2/player/models/V8FVunJqCj7/thumb","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7b00858efd8b5bb540715d5b0ba1c99f-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8a3ef465e0a9c8b3cbbbec7d66d10d18-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3a74ef41fd2b6d07bbc977c1cd623485-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"176554892"}
