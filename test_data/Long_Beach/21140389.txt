This sun-drenched 1953 Lanai model Cliff May Rancho exemplifies mid-century modern design and architecture with modern, timeless updates. Post and beam ceilings, original casement windows and the iconic \"Cliff May corner\" illuminates the bright, open floor plan of the main living area; an open concept kitchen, dining room and sitting area surrounding the wood-burning fireplace. Luxury plank SPC oak floors throughout are as inviting as they are durable. The entertainer's kitchen is the centerpiece of this home with a massive Carrara-marble topped island and countertops, solid-wood farmhouse cabinets with matte black hardware, a geometric cubic motif backsplash and brass wall sconces. Every square foot has been ingeniously utilized, providing not only an abundance of storage, including two pantries but also an enclosed laundry room and linen closet, adjacent to the kitchen.     In the dining room, the white-oak slat wall pays homage to the Cliff May birch accent wall and ties in natural, organic materials in a modern application creating a contemporary beach house ambiance. Primary bedroom is the quintessential Cliff May bedroom suite with double doors to the private backyard and an abundance of light from the three sides of windows. A custom paneled wall creates a subtle accent below the clerestory windows. The walk-in closet adjacent to the primary bathroom provides storage and organization with built-in shelving and drawers, the en-suite primary bath is cleverly accented with monochrome wallpaper, matte black hardware and brass lighting fixtures.    Double doors lead to a private outdoor lounge area with a fire pit and lush landscaping. Double doors connect the main living area to the secluded backyard with a terraced design to incorporate a spacious level of evergreen, durable turf and a lower level for entertaining or alfresco dining. Built-in poured concrete pavers, river rock, fruit trees and flowerbeds blooming with tropical vegetation create an outdoor oasis to enjoy the beautiful Southern California climate. Fully paid off solar panels and has been equipped for electric car charging. Close proximity to El Dorado Park and nature center, convenient shopping and dining and an incredible community of neighbors in a welcoming and social neighborhood makes this home not just an architectural showpiece but also a forever home.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/13d205bc63ed04976033741d9b69cd4a-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://my.matterport.com/api/v2/player/models/cCjb4LCdxgN/thumb","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8bc0ff2562cca7ae2055325ca09eb186-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f0682e016bf2031f5fb6808d561e731f-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c1761cc82267e34480494c5fbb823efc-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"21140389"}
