Let's roll of those sleeves and start creating the possibilities. Remodel an amazing floating home or build new! A home up to approx 1960 square feet can be built in this slip. The rare off-street parking space for this home is on the east side of Fairview in a private parking lot. Tenas Chuck Co-op consists of 32 floating homes in a close knit community. Homes are plumbed for natural gas, the dock has new pilings and all the utilities are under the dock for clean site lines to admire the protected views of the Space Needle, Queen Anne, Fremont Bridge, & Gas Works Park.
