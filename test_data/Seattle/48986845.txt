Easy access to light rail, I-5, and just minutes to all that Northgate has to offer. Complex just did fabulous renovations - siding, elevator, windows, decks, AND the strong HOA is still fully funded! You have a swimming pool for the summer and a cozy fireplace for the cold days with this cute 2 bedroom, 1.75 bath unit. Pet friendly and no rental cap. Secure parking.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7c3312b812235d621680a70ac6cf950a-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cbfda0705fb82726372c08c3be128412-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e0e5df83f9fbf6758ae9a11c73391157-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/052ebdaa4221ba34881a6484c7cb5cb4-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7668ca75ab79b946be32398e3e7323c6-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"48986845"}
