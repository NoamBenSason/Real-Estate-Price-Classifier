{"price":"$1,115,000","bed":"3","bath":"2","sqft":"1,744","address":"23715 Tiara St, Woodland Hills, CA 91367","overview":"In 1967, the current owners chose their home on Tiara because it had a pool on a quiet  cul-de-sac. Along with that, they benefited from the fine local schools:  Lockhurst, the  elementary school close by; Hale, the middle school around the corner; and El Camino,  the high school right up the street.  56 years later, not much has changed. The ensconced entertainer's backyard with the sparkling pool  and verdant, well-established landscaping in this quiet cul-de-sac are still attractive  features. The three neighborhood schools are now award-winning Charter schools. The  Woodcrest pocket is still a special sought after Woodland Hills area.  But the larger Woodland Hills has changed greatly.  There is the burgeoning Warner  Development from Topanga to Canoga. Close by is the Calabasas Commons.  Woodland Hills is now a destination site.  The owners were detail oriented. They kept the house in good order, updating, painting, and   meticulously repairing what needed to be repaired. Some features and improvements: step-down living and family rooms and primary bedroom, primary with  en suite walk-in shower, floor-to-ceiling raised hearth stone and brick double fireplace, direct access to two-car garage, service porch off kitchen, custom-made stained glass in entry door and three within home, double pane vinyl windows, sliders leading to entertainer's private pool/grassy backyard, smooth ceilings, ceiling fans, modern flooring, carpeting over hardwood, paint and wallpaper over the plaster walls, new (three months) a/c compressor, full copper plumbing, granite counters in the kitchen.  And now it’s time for a new owner’s adventure. The hummingbirds that danced for them may now bring you delight--this solid home with its pristine pool that enticed that family and changed their life may do the same for you.  Your private oasis awaits.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6ad01981c840dfdd1b78f8d05f9ddf70-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b9bc34093a0649e1d7bb0519398f25cd-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/87711c613df21bca4abdcb52746b738a-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/91023e3302f9961ff231a9971887d936-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9a15823a323d2ca6e5ead20f64815702-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"19880514"}
