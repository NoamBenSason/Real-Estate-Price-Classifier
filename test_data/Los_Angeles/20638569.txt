Journey back to 1905, where this captivating Queen Anne Victorian home stands as a timeless treasure in Lincoln Heights. Though once resplendent, it now vacant and awaits a grand restoration, presenting itself as a remarkable fixer-upper opportunity for those with a penchant for restoration and history. And boy does she have history! 2115 Gates was featured in several commercials and TV shows throughout the years because of her alluring curb appeal, but her big close-up was in the movie starring Angela Bassett in, \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" in 1993.  It's safe to say she's been turning heads for over 118 years, and her sister property- also for sale immediately next door at 2119 Gates -was also once a real looker in her day! 2115's original features include her bay window, original front door with extremely rare Victorian era key and hardware, coved ceilings, and exquisite milk glass pendant light fixtures, the ambiance evokes a bygone era. You can almost hear the record playing on the Victrola in the living room next to the bay window.  The kitchen is in original condition and now in need of restoration, but it holds the potential to shine brilliantly once more, echoing the glamor of the Queen Anne era! Look for the butterfly hinges on the cabinets!  The front bedroom is generously-sized, with original crystal door knobs, and original flush mount ceiling light fixture, a pass-through closet, and the main bathroom connecting to the Jack & Jill bathroom, which was updated in the past few years, still retaining its old world charms.  The second bedroom features carpeting and original windows and leads to the 3rd bedroom, which could serve as a divine office, sewing or craft room. Beyond the kitchen's embrace lies an enclosed patio, transformed into a laundry and storage area complemented by a quaint  bathroom, offering a glimpse into the past. Retreat to the backyard to find a California basement for extra storage, could be a delightful wine cellar mayhaps? Then find yourself amongst citrus trees for shade and a carport to house your Ford Model T. Encompassing a well-proportioned lot, this property offers ample room for expansion and creativity, making it a true canvas for a visionary restoration. The prospect of owning BOTH properties presents a unique opportunity to create an urban compound with endless possibilities. Seize this rare chance to breathe new life into a once-grand residence in the heart of Lincoln Heights!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ecfd25e20f74990f1c2b9c227851d1e8-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/24d8407d7a785bb0ff2a8b21974e81e2-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f0db349ba0de70bae688ee4361a036cb-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ecfd25e20f74990f1c2b9c227851d1e8-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/24d8407d7a785bb0ff2a8b21974e81e2-cc_ft_960.jpg"],"zpid":"20638569"}
