{"price":"$499,000","bed":"2","bath":"2","sqft":"854","address":"2119 Gates St,Â Los Angeles, CA 90031","overview":"Calling out to history enthusiasts and visionaries alike, this fixer-upper Victorian gem invites those with an appreciation for the past and a passion for restoration! Built in 1907, this once magnificent Shingle-Style Victorian residence sits amid the blossoming district of Lincoln Heights. The 2 bedroom 1 1/4 bath timeless gem has been owned by the same family since 1924 and retains much of its original charm. As you set foot on the porch you'll notice terrazzo steps, original wood shingles sloping gracefully on the curved front porch, the bay window, a vintage Victorian doorbell needing some mending & tending, and an old fashioned mailbox, and that's just a hint of what's to come!  Inside, you'll be enchanted by the authentic character that surrounds you; original single-hung windows, and original Douglas fir floors that are begging to be refinished. Look up to find coved ceilings, and there, illuminating the ambiance, an authentic milk glass pendant light fixture from days gone by. Replete with original character built-ins adored with crystal knobs, and a decorative fireplace, each a testament to its historical significance. As the story goes, back in the roaring twenties the kitchen and bathroom was adorned with mesmerizing Terrazzo creations by none other than a skilled family of Italian immigrant Terrazzo contractors who resided there. With a touch of tender care by skilled hands, those tri-color Terrazzo countertops shall radiate once more, exuding an ageless allure.  The front and back bedrooms also need proper elbow grease, and are situated Jack & Jill style between the main bathroom, where original Terrazzo floors meet a classic pedestal sink and a sunken tub flanked by Terrazzo-clad walls, now awaiting the chance to be rejuvenated and cherished once again. Off the kitchen is an enclosed patio serving as the laundry area, accompanied by a quaint quarter bathroom. But this Victorian Beauty Queen has a SISTER and she's just as cute as a button! The adjacent property at 2115 Gates Avenue, bearing a striking similarity in style, shall also be offered for sale. Together or apart, these properties are poised to complement each other, transforming into an extraordinary urban compound with limitless potential. BOTH ARE DELIVERED VACANT. Harkening back to the year 1873, Lincoln Heights has the distinction of being the inaugural suburb of the City of Angels. Revered for its architectural splendor, and being within close proximity to the bustling Downtown LA, this neighborhood flourishes with a burgeoning culinary and bar scene. Local hotspots such as Mazel, La Monarcha, Tierre Mia, The Heights Deli & Bottle Shop, Moo's Craft Barbecue, and Benny Boy Brewing have turned all eyes upon Lincoln Heights. Act swiftly, for an opportunity like this may not come again!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9f54820156fc17120bf178da498d73d1-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/24d8407d7a785bb0ff2a8b21974e81e2-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1ba2afb8ce908c73e87ebc2a138ad7c6-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b1a16af03681e9fad64b1a3b2bfc663a-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/83a4e478b98693d2c48e278f5c50be81-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"20638568"}
