As you enter you can feel the love and great energy that fills this home. Enjoy a traditional layout,  with a true master bedroom, and two spacious secondary rooms that share a hallway bathroom. The family room is conveniently located on the opposite end of the home which is great for hosting parties, or night owls that don’t want to disturb sleeping family members. The kitchen has plenty of cabinet and counter space, suitable for hosting Thanksgiving dinner. And, the backyard is a large beautiful blank canvas waiting for your imagination to run wild. This property is wonderfully located on the east side of the 210, and safely tucked away on a cul de sac. Its walking distance to Mission College, and El Cariso Park. Amazing opportunity for a first time home buyer looking for a great deal, and a chance to make some sweat equity. Or, an investor looking for a great rental property. Don’t miss out on your chance to become a homeowner!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a0686fcc9f91c8f491b6ee77419d29d0-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c67301c3c6f9b863220fb43e0c02d156-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b74e5e52b2e6bf36c149fb810649b493-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/38aa23d07eb540d03a66f975ecd5a089-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d98cd8d9845178c846d81f87d75bca78-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"20075703"}
