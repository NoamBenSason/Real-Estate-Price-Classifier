This property is waiting for a creative makeover to fit the objectives of a savvy investor. The majority of the necessary work would be cosmetic at best. Visualize a picturesque front and rear yard, decorative exterior paint and an interior full of modern comfort. The livable area is approximately 1,012 square feet with a moderately sized backyard and a garage that accounts for increased potential as a granny flat conversion. There are two bedrooms and one full bathroom, plenty of natural light, and ample ventilation. Property is part of  decedent's estate in an active probate case. The administrator has been granted limited authority as of list date but may petition the court for full authority. Investors may submit offers subject to interior inspection (see showing instructions for open date). Bring your highest and best.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a26fd6a82531ee7823a3dc9a66315986-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a26fd6a82531ee7823a3dc9a66315986-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://www.zillowstatic.com/s3/hdp/home-details/images/video-tile-placeholder.jpg"],"zpid":"20939316"}
