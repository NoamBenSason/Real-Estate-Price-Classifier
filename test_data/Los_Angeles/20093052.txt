{"price":"$749,000","bed":"3","bath":"2","sqft":"1,656","address":"10842 Owens Pl,Â Tujunga, CA 91042","overview":"Incredible views abound in this Seven Hills gem. Seven Hills is arguably the most desirable part of Tujunga, and this home has the advantage of both having some of the best views in the neighborhood, as well as being a few hundred square feet larger than several of its neighbors.  Past the spacious driveway and attached garage lies the gated front yard with covered patio, shade from mature trees and outdoor cooking area. Inside, the home has a phenomenal floor plan with open, newly remodeled kitchen and cathedral ceilings in the living room.  On the other side of the fireplace is the very large family room also with cathedral ceiling and with new recessed lights, and the incredible views to the south.  The south facing patio at the front of the house offers another great vantage point for views of city twinkling lights, not to mention being the best place to watch the fireworks shows.  The north wing of the house features junior bath and two junior bedrooms, as well as the master suite that lies behind double doors. The home has had a number of upgrades, including new roof from 2022, newer attic insulation (2017), kitchen remodel, new paint, several dual pane windows, Nest thermostat and Ring cameras, new ceiling lights from West Elm and stunning quartz chandelier from CB2. Finally, the backyard pergola offers truly panoramic views, and its several terraces offer great use of the hillside for the gardener. This is your private escape from LA.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3e0ad8d936eabf6226635fd70a967ab4-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/280643c7272ff30251256ea88ca1e6f2-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cd16a7dc23d3373053fcb0eff2076d6f-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/fb2176fb924152a678532a1e6065839d-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/66fa3fbbb6f2999fbe5bb713a7156bb9-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"20093052"}
