Originally built in 1907, this two bed, two bath Victorian style home is near the Upper Noe Valley Rec Center, tech shuttles, the J church muni light rail, Glen Park BART station, and access to I-280 freeway. The upper level features two bedrooms and one bathroom with an eat-in kitchen, downtown views from the front room, and a family room at the rear that opens to a sun-drenched yard. The lower level of the home is not connected with an interior staircase at this time and features one bathroom with several additional rooms and independent street access. There is also an attic space that can be accessed from the rear yard. Combine all the levels together for a larger single-family home? Finish out the lower space as an ADU? Add a garage? Regardless of how you finish the interior of 235 Randall for your needs, the home has location, location, location with a very walkable 89 walkscore, excellent transit score of 81 and very bikeable bike score of 73.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/669353521c155b33d22329a31e930093-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://my.matterport.com/api/v2/player/models/6aJfXXZoCSF/thumb","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/224de022c112d146596da9f7587be74b-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/fc19d2e5ba85a739ec6dde00835441ac-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/87c62db7ab11a9f9022bf07e6f07a6fc-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"15184056"}
