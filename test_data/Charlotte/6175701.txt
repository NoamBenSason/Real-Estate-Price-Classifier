{"price":"$165,000","bed":"4","bath":"1","sqft":"1,003","address":"4013 Westway Dr,Â Charlotte, NC 28208","overview":"This property features a shared driveway, providing convenient access for multiple vehicles at the back of the property. One of the standout features is the recently installed HVAC system in 2022 and the original wood floors.\r\nThe main level of the home offers 1003 square feet of heated living space. However, it's worth noting that 84 square feet of this area appears to have been added without proper permits.  Moving to the second level, there is an additional 384 square feet of space. While this area is not counted as heated square feet due to ceiling height restrictions, it is important to note that this portion of the property also appears to lack proper permits. The listing agent has an ownership interest in this property.  The property is being sold \"as-is\" and is priced accordingly, the home needs work. This means that the sale includes the property in its current condition, including any existing issues or areas that require attention.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/119659c913b5d36e06c25a0fe74b67c4-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6a8e39948347033451750c1fa7807cb3-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/65a41afa300a67ee6e1bf45a48792a14-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/84844d61a854709c3ceea5970eb6d399-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/031dd18329a2afee7dde547469a386a8-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"6175701"}
