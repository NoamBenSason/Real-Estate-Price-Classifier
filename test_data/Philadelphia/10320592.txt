Not too many stairs. And large bedrooms on the second floor, each with great closets and their own full bath, which gives those sharing their own space. Plus a handy powder room and laundry on the first floor + backyard. This handsome brick home was renovated in 2015 with a thoughtful designer mindset. Exposed brick accent wall in the living room, hardwood floors, contemporary stairs, custom kitchen and baths. Enter through the vestibule into the wide open living/dining area with plenty of windows bringing in light. Modern kitchen with lots of storage and counter space. Powder room and washer/dryer beyond the kitchen leading to a private backyard. Upstairs, the perfect set-up with unusual depth accommodating 2 bedrooms/2 full baths. There's also a finished basement that's comfortable for hanging out watching the games, an at-home office, gym or yoga studio, guest space or storage. The 2200 block of Catharine is wide, peaceful and not much traffic being above 22nd St. Easier to park, too. The location, convenient to the South Street Bridge to Penn/CHOP and University City, Fitler Square, Julian Abel Park and Schuylkill River Park, makes this a most sought after spot. Even more fun with Graduate Hospital favorites like Los Camaradas, Sidecar, Ultimo Coffee, Grace Tavern, City Fitness, Catharine Park, Doggie Style Pets and Sabrina's Cafe nearby.
