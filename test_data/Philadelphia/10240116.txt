{"price":"$205,000","bed":"6","bath":"1","sqft":"2,290","address":"4617 Newhall St,Â Philadelphia, PA 19144","overview":"Best and Final Offers due Friday at 12pm. This Queen Anne Victorian twin in developing West Germantown is a rare example of an untouched original charm. A long and private green front yard sets this privately off the quiet tree-filled side street with a gated front entry. The wrap around porch has a side entry as well as double doors that open straight off the parlor. Walking through the front door puts you in the entry hall with the original staircase and banister as well as a diamond window into a wainscotted pantry closet--the first instance of probable yellow pine that appears throughout the home. The front parlor has a wood-burning fireplace, a bank of three windows and the double door entry to the porch. Continuing to the rear of the house places you in the dining room with a chair rail molding. Behind that used to sit the kitchen that has an entry to servant stairs and the basement, as well as access to the rear former laundry room/pantry that would be a natural place to add a second full bath or a half bath. Access is here to the rear yard. Upstairs, you'll find six bedrooms. In this style of home, the front two bedrooms on each floor are massive and the second floor bedroom has an impressive second fireplace with a mirror built into the mantel. On this floor, the full bath is located. There is space right above it on the third floor to add another full bath to that floor, perhaps expanding it into a primary suite. The servant staircase does something unique--it has a stained glass window at the top that is accessible off a small landing out a rear bedroom door. A built-in gate sits at the top of the servant stairs. The third floor has working transom windows. One of the bedrooms here was used as a crafting studio and has floor paper down over the original pine. The basement holds the mechanicals--to the best of our knowledge, the furnace is on the newer side as well as the water heater. A newer condenser is outside. It is believed to be oil heat. Can be converted into a duplex under the zoning code.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/660a41cb21188395baab8f5f966b9b7a-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a223efa42de2f75dca88770ddcc3f329-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/58dfd74e57239948c1d5ce72eeefd00c-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/39e636def0af7e0bdfa81912182deb3f-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f4c2214d1a29c2d7c851072193128fa3-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"10240116"}
