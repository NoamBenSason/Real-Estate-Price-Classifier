{"price":"$3,250,000","bed":"8","bath":"5","sqft":"11,360","address":"455-461 W Chestnut Hill Ave,Â Philadelphia, PA 19118","overview":"Once in a generation opportunity to own one of the most significant properties in Philadelphia.  Named \"Binderton\" by its first owner J. Wilmer Biddle, and  designed by Cope & Stewardson Architects (also designed for University of Pennsylvania and Princeton), the house was started in 1903 and finished in 1906.   The renowned landscape architecture  firm of the Olmsted Brothers was engaged to handle landscape, hardscape, and garden design.  During their ownership, the present owners purchased 461 W Chestnut Hill Ave. (which had been subdivided from the original plot many years earlier)  demolished the modest house that existed , and expanded the property and gardens, and  redesigned the driveway.  Situated on the quietest street in Chestnut Hill and surrounded by homes of equal caliber, Binderton stands out with its brilliant red brick construction and distinctive Jacobean Revival (or Jacobethan) style , with shaped parapets, and intricately designed chimneys.   In most places, the house is designed only one room deep and was built linearly, near the property line at the high side.  The front yard slightly slopes toward Towanda Street. The brilliance of the Olmsted Brothers work is apparent in the brick walkway  that rises elegantly from Towanda Street up a gradual hill with a low step every 20 feet or so.    From the stone patio, enter the front door  into the formal entry hall with main staircase at the back. The foyer is filled with natural light from two sides, a fireplace, a  powder room, and a large coat room with window.  Again from the  entry hall, walk into, what was  called in 1906,  the \"Ladies'' Parlor\", a sunny, elegant sitting room with big windows and a fireplace.   The formal living room with two distinct seating areas, beamed ceiling , and wood burning fireplace can be accessed from the \"ladies'' parlor\" or directly from a hallway with window seat for a  tete-a-tete.  The exterior door off the living room leads to a spacious loggia with beautifully tiled floor and finished ceiling.  To the left of the front door, head to  the formal dining room with fireplace, elegant crystal chandelier and room for  a second dining table!  The kitchen end of the house is more than you have imagined.  From the front hall,  head through the butler''s pantry with lighted cabinetry,  porcelain sink , and dishwasher: a  great spot to set up the bar on party nights.  Further on you reach the supersized chef''s kitchen with two sinks, three ovens, a six-burner range, banquette seating for conversation while prepping dinner,  stools at the counter for breakfasts on a busy day, and a big table at the end of the house  for casual dinners. Off the kitchen is a huge pantry area and laundry room with an extra fridge and another sink.  At the kitchen end of the house is a glassed in garden porch that will serve myriad functions that make daily living more convenient.  Head up the carved and turned staircase and turn left at the top to reach the primary suite.  This sweet space includes the bedroom with fireplace and door to second floor balcony, a cozy sitting room, great for reading or streaming late into the night, a beautiful, bright corner office/den, and a spacious bathroom with two sinks and walk-in shower.  On the second floor to the right of the main stair are four additional bedrooms, two of which share a jack-and-jill bath ; and two others that share an additional hall bath.   The third floor has three  bedrooms, a full bath, and a large central room, perfect for play or privacy.   The 1.6 acres that surround the house defy description.  Mature trees, abundant perennial beds, lush lawns, and garden rooms; one prettier than the next.  The main focus in the summer is the pool area. Exquisitely private with its walled garden, and elegant brick pool house, it is here where you can escape from the sun and the world.    Built to span the ages,  Binderton will pass to someone who loves grand old  houses and understands stewardship.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cec40e7f4a9ffdb93650175a09f4d064-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/df10c5a7b19886af99700ba7a9465866-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/febd0f5167454ef806c4e29562b5479a-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/200e692f38daed5d38c9233df431392d-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a06597a66612b7007f8072f1ce67cd33-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"2056958324"}
