{"price":"$325,000","bed":"2","bath":"1","sqft":"1,022","address":"1223 South St #B, Philadelphia, PA 19147","overview":"Live in the heart of Philly, one and a half blocks away from Broad St and its entertainment, restaurants, and subway. Live on one of the coolest streets in town, South St, two blocks away from Whole Foods. And best of all, have your own designated GATED PARKING! Yes, this 2-bedroom and 1 bathroom condo is in one of the best locations in the city. You can literally walk to the best theaters in town, shopping, and more. Even better, unit B is not street level, and neither on top getting roasted by the sun during the summer and getting chilly during the winter. This special unit sits high from South street and has its own private balcony. Being south facing, this condo gets ample daylight throughout the day. The open layout of the living room, dining area, and kitchen is a signature of modern living where hanging out, cooking, and entertaining all come together in one homogeneous space. A wide semi-island and its overhang separate the kitchen from the living room and it is perfect for extra countertop space, and eating. The two bedrooms are spacious, and the primary one has a generous walk-in closet. The bathroom is located in the hallway near both bedrooms and the main living area. This special condo includes its in-unit washer and dryer, and separate HVAC, heater and air-conditioning system. Note that the parking lot, where your designated parking spot is located, can be accessed through two secure gates, one on 12th St and one on 13th St. Also, there is a common courtyard for everyone’s use and it is perfect for some outdoor relaxing time. BTW, this special community is pet friendly. If being centrally located, steps away from the best things Philly has to offer, and having your own private and gated parking spot while paying low association fees is what you are looking for, this rarely offered condo is the one for you.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9b4104ef64a5f61ee6311fdb1a422e70-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9fb330193c9b132fd38334595605f902-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/dc750236e222b362cec7c7b4711deab5-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/651c677e3e485c93217a6f74bf3dd855-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/baacb38f0b96ab3aa7cf410548589269-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"2056388473"}
