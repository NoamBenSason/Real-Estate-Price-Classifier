{"price":"$289,000","bed":"3","bath":"2","sqft":"915","address":"7 Earl Ct, Philadelphia, PA 19125","overview":"This end-of-row expanded trinity on sweet little brick-pathed Earl Court is move-in ready and offers awesome outdoor space via a large private rear yard, an uber-charming shared garden and super-easy potential to add a third-floor deck. The living room is sunny and bright, thanks to sliding glass doors off the kitchen leading to the back yard with patio and planting beds. The ceramic tiled eat-in kitchen has full-sized appliances, including a dishwasher, and plenty of storage space in crisp white cabinets. The second floor offers two bedrooms; one has a large closet and the other has one small closet plus a bonus linen closet. They share a ceramic tiled hall bath. The third floor is a sun-soaked loft with a full-wall closet, half bath with black-and-white hex tile floor and pedestal sink, and a door out to the rear roof that’s just begging to be finished as a deck. Freshly painted and with central air, basement laundry and a 15-year roof warranty, this is that ever-so-rare true starter home in an ideal Fishtown location. In the Adaire catchment, the immediate area has a quiet residential vibe but is easily walkable to Frankford and Girard aves.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4b1b03b3d438ff4799659cbc96c1a870-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d86773112a265f2ac435cd16cb22adde-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5e758b3db6f4666daf1be4ce0ae011c1-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e92f9e888c306c7e2372af1e6fa4145c-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/16023cfd8487cebbb93a90a3ba359edc-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"10256783"}
