As you enter your new home, you enter your enclosed porch, perfect for savoring your morning cup of coffee while browsing your social media feed.  As you step into your living room, you can feel the coolness from your new central air system and notice your extremely durable and waterproof wood laminate flooring, impervious to pets, kids, and even high heels.  With its open floor plan, you can effortlessly stay engaged with your friends during game night or date night and keep an eye on your kids while preparing a snack in your sleek kitchen.  Your updated white kitchen has black accents that tie perfectly in with your stainless-steel appliances and your almost indestructible quartz countertops, highlighting your elegant hexagon matte porcelain tile backsplash. You’ll also find your half-bathroom on this level. How convenient!  As you venture upstairs, your new plush soft, casual cream carpet extends into all three spacious bedrooms. You could use one of these bedrooms as your home office or sanctuary.  Your main full bathroom is bright and airy and boasts a similar modern design and feel as your kitchen.    Your home also has a one-car garage and convenient parking.  You can enter your home from the garage, where you will find your unfinished basement left to unleash your creativity and design something unique when ready.
