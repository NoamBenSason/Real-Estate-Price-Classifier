Completely refurbished in 2022 & 23.This Lloyd Wright is a sublime midcentury modern home.

From the living areas to the bedrooms, to the massive windows that almost bring the local greenery inside with you.

A double sided brick fireplace rises like a tree out of the original hardwood floors. The primary bedroom is nestled in the corner of the back yard so you can see across the entire back garden. The kitchen provides you a view down the lovely curving street. Lloyd made sure that no matter where you are in the house, there is always a foreground, mid-ground, and background. These are just a few of the amazing aspects of a design that needs to be seen rather than read about.  While all of that design is amazing to look at, the house begs to be lived in. The refurbishment included an enormous list of custom projects. These range from all new custom facades (notched exactly like the originals), new custom doors (also designed alike the originals), custom hardwood floor refinishing, custom side panels, and many more. In addition to rehabbing Lloyd’s original designs, there is also a new; roof, foundation and reinforced, copper plumbing, electrical, appliances, glass windows and railings throughout, kitchen counters, LED lighting with smart switches, smart thermostat, air conditioner, forced air heat and ducting, bathroom tile, tubs, showers, front deck, EV charging outlets, wood fencing, and much more. The renovations also included remodeling the basement to create 780 square feet of new living space, all matching Lloyd’s original style and feel. This architectural wonder is ready to be lived in now. The timeless designs of Lloyd Wright combined with a complete modernization, entrusts this home with all of the classic architectural style of Lloyd Wright's architectural design, merged with all 2023 code requirements.",https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8285838cffbbc9a6c3e24262914468a8-cc_ft_960.jpg,2.85,False

The house, known as the View Master house, not only for the visually SPECTACULAR vistas of the Pacific Northwest, but also in honor of the original commissioning owner, who was chief design engineer of the iconic View Master viewer. From the very beginning, this home was awash in creativity. The original owner hired acclaimed architect Roscoe Hemenway to create a modern dwelling that captured the endless views & brought modern to life inside the home.  In 2006 the home passed to another creative force, when a Nike marketing executive and his family purchased the home. In 2011, this stunning spot on Council Crest was re-imagined & remodeled when the current owners placed the well-preserved masterpiece into the hands Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.
