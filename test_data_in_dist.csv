Larson in 1928, this was once home to the family of Clifford Clinton, founder of the famous Clifton's Cafeteria. This formidable Spanish Colonial Revival is replete with impressive architectural detailing indicative of a bygone era, when flower fields and orange groves dotted the hills below the Observatory. Beyond the hedged and gated wraparound frontage spanning 230', Juliette balconies, decorative ironwork, tiled courtyards and patios, and red clay rooflines demonstrate the richness of period architecture rarely found. Romance unfolds inside, past the magnesite entry and foyer, through a deep arched threshold is the formal living room anchored by a grand fireplace, beautifully intact stained glass, and coffered ceilings, with French doors opening to a large tiled veranda. The dining room boasts impressive stained glass picture window, and opens to a front courtyard. Rare robin's egg blue original tile, wooden countertops, and lighting fixtures are found in the butler's pantry and kitchen tucked next to a sunny breakfast room. A stately office with hand stenciled ceilings, paneling, and fireplace is privately situated off the grand staircase.

On the lower level, unwind and host movie nights in the screening room with plush seating for six.

Today, the tiled deco pool area remains a sunny gathering place; nearby a grassy knoll and dining pavilion provide a shady respite from the main entertaining space. Through a discrete gated driveway, the motor court and 3 car garage offer plenty of parking.
