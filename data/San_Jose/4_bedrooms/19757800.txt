Lovingly cared for by the same family for over 47 years, this versatile and open floorplan is currently configured with three bedrooms plus a living room, family room/office, AND large bonus finished sunroom (not included in square footage) but can easily be returned to the four bedroom configuration reflected on county records.  Recent updates (by licensed GC) include an upgraded kitchen with quartz countertops and backsplash, refinished solid hardwood floors throughout, luxury waterproof flooring in the bonus sunroom, and recessed LED lighting.  Swing by a Fri/Sat/Sun open house to experience the warm and character of this home and uncommon pride of ownership of its neighborhood.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6f2897cdf6be977829308479e2821990-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6f010e77b7a7c1992d349a75f41ec0bf-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/056869b4c8f6b3a7f25b6758674154f7-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/296575455d2729ab92b1890aea593d67-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/de051d2b78fbe3c1664ec819672248d5-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"19757800"}
