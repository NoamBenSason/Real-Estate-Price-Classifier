{"price":"$1,149,000","bed":"3","bath":"2","sqft":"1,361","address":"710 Newport Ave, Long Beach, CA 90804","overview":"This stunning craftsman-style home combines classic charm with modern comfort for an incredible living experience. Every inch of this home has been meticulously designed, starting from the newly paved concrete walkway. With so many upgrades, it's hard to know where to begin. The open-concept interior has been freshly painted and features textured walls, new interior and closet doors, and stylish hardware. You'll love the new front door and double-pane windows throughout (except for the front windows, which maintain the home's classic look). The first bathroom has retained its original floor tile, adding character to this historic home. The second bathroom has been updated with new sink, toilet, and shower tile. The spacious kitchen is perfectly situated to capture natural light, making it the ideal spot to enjoy your morning coffee. Step outside to your own private oasis, complete with a beautifully remodeled zero-scaped yard, pergola, newly added irrigation, artificial turf, and Podocarpus trees lining the property. Oh, and did I mention Level 2 EV charging in the garage! And as a plus, this home has R2 zoning. Close proximity to so many restaurants and the surrounding shopping areas, and when all this wasn't enough, you are moments away from the beach. This home has it all – and it could be yours!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/271e5e3807821be8ec6ab8c531a50289-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/311eae541537027d13e8e514cb6d6e0c-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e4aa845b86c9c15066e2117cef9075b4-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/088da4d076268b024662c9d16a615fa4-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/49e10611a6ac5cfee9e3117878cc955b-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"21226254"}
