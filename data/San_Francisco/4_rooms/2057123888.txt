{"price":"$824,428","bed":"4","bath":"2","sqft":"1,420","address":"550-552 Athens St,Â San Francisco, CA 94112","overview":"Looks great from the street... The rest of the place needs TLC here and there.  Older building that has two units (although the City hasn't updated the records -- after years!)  Presently rented upper and lower unit, there is a 1-car garage and additional space below the living area (basement) with room to spare -- accessible through the rear. Price considers conditions & more.  Check it out, it is in the right place and with a little imagination you could turn this into a truly nice and conveniently located place -- right in the Excelsior.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cc04ef06dcad6d778b4099f00cc79451-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/bb70c25015e956d8662996b7a42d66bb-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1c7c3a3f5bc15fb7d370a4e2e3e80c7f-cc_ft_960.jpg"],"zpid":"2057123888"}
