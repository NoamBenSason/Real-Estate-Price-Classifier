{"price":"$1,495,000","bed":"3","bath":"2","sqft":"1,426","address":"465 30th St,Â San Francisco, CA 94131","overview":"This charming, updated home in the close-knit neighborhood community of Upper Noe Valley is move-in ready and yet has the potential to be significantly expanded to evolve with new life chapters. Completely detached and flooded with light, the home features an oversized living and dining room that frame downtown San Francisco and Bay Bridge views. A true 3 bedroom with an open living/dining room, the home comes with a separate family room that walks out directly to the rear garden creating a comfortable separation between the quiet and active parts of the home. A large eat-in kitchen comes with Corian countertops, new appliances and is flooded with morning light. Directly off the kitchen, a mudroom with laundry hookups make this part of the home very functional and supportive of a busy lifestyle. The home is complete with 2 large finished basement rooms that can flex in multiple ways (gym, workshop, office, storage). Hardwood floors, built-in shelving, and period tile accentuate the character of the home. Close to the Upper Noe Rec center and the Muni J line, coffee, restaurants and shops this is a dream location.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e28b72faf0967e285413eb3a88c799bd-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7c7f069216cdd8ab264245d9675eb6cb-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7a08186920e88f8b2066222ea089f037-cc_ft_960.jpg"],"zpid":"15183639"}
