The sleek interiors effortlessly showcase contemporary design, while the open layout seamlessly connects to breathtaking views of The city, stretching from the park to Pacific Heights and beyond. The top floor encompasses the living room, dining area, kitchen, two bedrooms, and one bathroom. Upstairs you will find the perfect retreat for a home office, artist studio, and so much more.  The living room is flooded with natural light and a wood burning fireplace. The design stenciled on the fireplace is custom to the home.  The subtle design was inspired by the trees across the street in Buena Vista Park. A tattoo artist etched it right onto the blackened steel.  The simplicity of the white cabinet and the steel create a pattern to reflect the historic trees across the road. Situated on the lowest level of the building, there is a separate guest suite. Featuring a spacious living area, kitchenette, and a full bathroom. The flexible space is the perfect home office or au pair quarters.The first floor condominium features 2 bedrooms and one bathroom.
