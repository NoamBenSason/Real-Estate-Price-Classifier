{"price":"$1,595,000","bed":"2","bath":"3","sqft":"--","address":"860 Waller St APT 3,Â San Francisco, CA 94117","overview":"Come for the city views, stay for a SFH-like condo that has it all in incredible location. This Victorian condo maintains all the lovable charm such as 11'+ ceilings, but is updated in just the right places, like a beautiful kitchen as the centerpiece of the living level, to make for the perfect modern experience. The condo is split in two levels, and has the rare benefit of having an exclusive garage + bonus room internally connected to the condo! The condo is serene and quiet, located in the back of the building, with a gated driveway, and just enough up Waller Street, yet is in the center of it all. Nestled between Buena Vista and Duboce Parks, not to mention Golden Gate park, the home is centrally located between Lower Haight, Cole Valley, Divisadero Street and NOPA, and Castro.  Truly divine location, perfect for living your best San Francisco life! The home is rounded out by a balcony off the dining room that showcases iconic San Francisco city views, in-unit laundry, and of course the ever-so-valuable flex space of the bonus room in the garage. The internal access makes the space functional as a gym, home-office, storage space, additional bike parking, or staging area for the families adventures and comings/goings.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/bf923839efa4cd37f8b9f175c3fdc789-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/dbe6db40f9dff0bee13268427e67fd5e-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2d1e11cffab833f8358463a5862d1462-cc_ft_960.jpg"],"zpid":"111926175"}
