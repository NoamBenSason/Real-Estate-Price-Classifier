{"price":"$798,000","bed":"2","bath":"1","sqft":"--","address":"1222 York St UNIT A,Â San Francisco, CA 94110","overview":"This is a hip, somewhat ecclectic yet traditional layout as a one floor flat, in the sunny Mission District. There are two surprisingly generous sized bedrooms, a large, sunny eat-in kitchen for entertaining, cozy living room, a nook for an office or library and an artsy private outdoor space in backyard for entertaining, creating a garden or relaxing. There is also a large attic that offers future expansion possibility (est. 700 sq. ft. attic by seller that does not cover the area over bathroom and the 100 sq ft office nook). This is a 75% interest in a tenancy-in-common. Just one or two blocks to many great neighborhood restaurants, shopping, groceries, coffee shops mass transit, and freeway access just several blocks away.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ba74b61ee7e84be302c452e9039970b3-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/fea812513f96c6abbe8fab4c0eea8230-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f7432db07c19b172687d4f1667e56db4-cc_ft_960.jpg"],"zpid":"2057324581"}
