This is a great platform for a little imagination and elbow grease to transform this great location into your dream pad. Nestled nicely adjacent to the Westchester Golf Course, this home has not been on the market since the late 1970's, and is incredibly value priced in the sub-$1M range. On a quieter street, it is well placed to access such amenities as local beaches, Westside eateries and bars, Playa and Marina del Rey, SoFi Stadium, freeways, the South Bay, Trader Joe's and more. Take advantage of this shot to snag the lowest priced single family home currently on the market in the neighborhood.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6ea11451e2aa733f32fec0929f7c6c35-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/60fca0160bc2c75ace5e1ebed4467128-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/62e5d4a454d3a676c17d076254348bf9-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c453d21f32f85da1208e78d9165aba2d-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/47a676ef01911abdcb40d227af4d4d5b-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"20389779"}
