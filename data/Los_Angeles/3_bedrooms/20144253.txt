Dotted with fruit trees and surrounded by an incredible passionfruit hedge, the welcoming front walkway - lined with fruit-laden strawberry plants - leads to the entry, which flows into the kitchen, dining room, family room, and living room, each flowing into one other.  Adjacent to the kitchen is a spacious laundry room and updated bathroom, which open out to the side yard.  Three bedrooms, flooded with natural light and each with large closets, surround the second full bathroom in a private corridor off the living room. A wonderful feature of this home is the custom double pane windows, allowing for wonderful ventilation each afternoon or the ability for maximum energy efficiency in winter and summer.  Conducive to seamless indoor and outdoor living and entertainment, the family room opens to a fabulous, covered patio with built-in flower beds, brick hardscaping, and storage area, leading down to additional patio space and the lush backyard, whose edible landscaping will be ready for harvest this summer and fall. The rear alley enables full use of the lot with a 2-car garage, an automatic gate that opens to an extra parking space inside the yard (suitable for RV or boat parking), and a shed perfectly suited for a workshop. This wonderful home is ready for the next generation of stewards who will certainly enjoy the beautiful space, rare ambiance, verdant privacy, and amazing garden that this home provides, plus the opportunity to make it their own!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/890a4198bef78a19aa72cb4871a0bc5c-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/967c49cd4b075d508778039bf9a40b4d-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b1c80ed783a9d17ce0f2fdca812868a6-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8a0ebf5de40a2f6ea552c4c77267ea4d-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a94a96e48e805ba4f1a148a216913e4c-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"20144253"}
