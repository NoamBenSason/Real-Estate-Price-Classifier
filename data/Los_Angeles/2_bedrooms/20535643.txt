Located barely a block from Whole Foods, this 2 bedroom rear, corner Penthouse with only one common wall features soaring beamed ceilings, unimpeded views from the city to the ocean and a spacious upstairs loft with rooftop access and more views. This home features the optimal floor plan with two voluminous ensuite bedrooms that are separated by massive living and dining room, ideal privacy for guests, a roommate, or as a home office. The unit also features an eat-in kitchen that opens to the entertainment areas and a side-by-side laundry closet. What's more, this sun-drenched, southwest-facing corner unit is fully exposed, yet uniquely private, a nearly impossible combo to find in Brentwood. The Brentwood Cedar Tree complex offers an open courtyard, was recently updated and is perfectly sited amid all the world class restaurants, shops, markets, and specialty coffee spots of Brentwood.  While this complex is in the heart of all the action, the penthouse is surprisingly serene with soothing cross breezes that meander through the interior's wide open spaces. Building amenities include controlled access, a swimmer's pool, a seriously well equipped exercise room, and secure side by side parking. Bring your imagination and contractor to create the home of your dreams. Minutes to UCLA, Westwood, Century City and Santa Monica beaches.  Photos of interior (coming soon) will include virtual renovation concepts. Probate sale with no court overbid requirement. Property sold \"AS IS\".  Fireplace is decorative only.  Association pet rules on file.  Priced for optimal interest.  Enjoy Brentwood living at its finest!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d0995c0ed403c66bac667553b4ab7ae5-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/33ffe81ebc41efd5ac90125e0e5314a7-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/05586fd2f4ace92ec34d4043d1f1e26b-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/920a64383f7bcf59fd237e6c38113f02-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2453c739f051d3f703eb0caade7e865a-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"20535643"}
