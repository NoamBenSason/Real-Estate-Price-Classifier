Thoughtfully renovated with sustainability in mind, this tranquil home is the epitome of laid-back cool. Enter through a Dutch door to an open living and dining room with a custom L-shaped sofa featuring Suay cushions, lightened hardwood floors and Katy Skeleton light fixture. Two large French doors open to a private dining patio set under a pergola draped in wisteria and surrounded by various fruit trees - the perfect spot to bbq and chill with friends. The kitchen design maximizes storage and workspace with custom cabinets, wood counters and Fireclay tile - all conspiring to make this your favorite room. The overall palate, both muted and soft, carries throughout the bedrooms spaces which feature updated wood windows and share a renovated bathroom, with Fireclay tile and a walk-in shower. A covered patio off the rear bedroom is a full extension of your living room and a private sanctuary screened from the neighbors by mature hedges and framed by the trailing leaves of an old-growth grape vine, a vestige of the last family who lived here. A finished garage houses the laundry and could easily double as a work space. Located in popular Atwater Village with dining and shopping nearby, and just a stone's throw from the LA River bike path, this one is easy to fall in love with!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/422abf591e64dc268d11d9c6341e83d7-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f7efbd314bb26bd2a1fb8a46d5eeb91e-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b09b19f0adeb2470e40f3e9dbe3d3972-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5af65f9d15f81542bdc57dccd827fdaf-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/be7cedd71c8bd83f8144b0b847ce5777-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"20751370"}
