{"price":"$1,425,000","bed":"5","bath":"2","sqft":"2,570","address":"625 48th St,Â Sacramento, CA 95819","overview":"Architect's Own Brick Tudor in the heart of East Sacramento. When the home was purchased 35 years ago, the owner's vision was to maximize the potential to expand while respecting the character and charm we've come to love about East Sac.  The downstairs is reminiscent of your classic Tudor: original hardwood floors, cozy family room with fireplace, custom cabinetry and formal dining room. Natural light radiates from a sunroom, a great place to enjoy a book or children's play area. The open galley kitchen is complete with breakfast nook, pantry, and Spanish tile floors. The two downstairs bedrooms are spacious and perfect for an office or guest bedroom(s). It's the upstairs that transforms this classic into a truly spectacular home.  The skylights and architectural design allows for a brightness and elegance seldom felt on a second level. Featuring 3 more bedrooms, all with custom storage cabinetry. The large bathroom features Carrara marble, dual shower heads, makeup vanity and double sinks. The primary suite boasts tall ceilings, a walk-in closet (with laundry chute) and a balcony overlooking the backyard. The backyard has a desirable eastern exposure with plenty of space to relax and entertain. Other features include: 1.5 car garage, basement, two HVAC systems, and much more!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/078776dc2ad35b89e9aa3a0caecc197a-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5ef0fe6ff7cf9ac63f94b087621ae95b-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8bc122e659fa14b8380091b95740a779-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/865f4e947835aaec55d616b8d4c4b24d-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3523dcf69121cdd40b3c348033d7341c-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"25781489"}
