This turn-key home has a new water heater, microwave, garbage disposal, fresh paint and flooring inside. Newly restored and painted expansive deck. And, the location is phenomenal. One of the best in the park. Backs to a serene greenbelt that often has turkeys roaming around. Did we mention that the space rent is currently only $505 per month? This is an incredible opprtunity to live in a nice place with low costs.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a74b487961e9dc6701b097c8d7fbbf18-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6cf27ea865687fc75cde3804691e50b2-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/dfd604b04d71d74b4983142e581f481d-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6da68b601ece62e42d3057bada992272-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/008faf48108eeead580f306f1b7ea3eb-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"59381392"}
