{"price":"$650,000","bed":"4","bath":"3","sqft":"3,136","address":"4437 N Wishon Ave,Â Fresno, CA 93704","overview":"Much desired and stellar home, in the Old Figarden neighborhood. New flooring in most areas. An open concept with spacious bedrooms. Master bedroom highlights antique toilets with bidet and exclusive exit to the pool and beautiful backyard scenery. The 2nd bathroom has a six Jet Jacuzzi with mood lights. This home also comes with an isolated bedroom with its own private balcony. The 3rd bathroom has clandestine access to the backyard. Formal dining room and bonus room features distinct fireplaces. The owners had the Le Cornue, Cheft's stove flown in from Paris. The generous floorplan and outdoor living space are perfect for entertaining guests. Convenient pool house was used as a gym, but could be used as a detached bedroom, studio apartment, or possible ADU, with some TLC. You are a short walk away from Christmas Tree Lane, Figarden Village which includes shopping, local cuisine, live music, and much more! Lot size 15,600 sq ft. The house is being sold AS-IS! Caretaker on the premises.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9fed97201da29f32f96dc45780e171ba-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/01258960a27f8abbcb5a04a8dd363d5f-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9593c9438a58b223658a4089603bf88e-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5c3bf093d5c77b91e1b095477c6fb975-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1bfdcf0faaaa6d1e0a32941332a5f1ba-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"18718901"}
