{"price":"$280,000","bed":"3","bath":"2","sqft":"1,408","address":"2486 S Page Ave,Â Fresno, CA 93725","overview":"Walk through the front door into a large open living room;  this 3 bedroom and 1.5 baths is in amazing condition. Natural morning light spills through east facing windows. They do not make them like this any more my grandmother would say. All 3 bedrooms are very nicely sized there is room for 2 beds and more and seen in the pictures. The large patio in the back is great for the hot summers and family gatherings. The roof, HVAC and windows are all newer. The garage is SUPER oversized. Did not notice the nice iron gate at the entrance? All of the heavy lifting has been done and the house has been tastefully upkeep. There is not much for you other than move in.This is absolutely a must-see on your list; all you need to do is move in.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c9b2b3c14528148b5a2555c4b3d3943f-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b134f822746a0b2c2e4fc14429726706-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8d83274723a743721687bb113f1069ca-cc_ft_960.jpg"],"zpid":"18771790"}
