Manufactured in 2022, the process of what it takes to get this new home planned and set up is no quick and easy feat, but here it is. It's done and ready for you. Before we go into this home, can we just give notice to the new landscaping and artificial turf. Walking around this lot, I can say pictures do not do it justice. This model-like home offers 1600 sq ft, with spacious 3 bedrooms, all with walk in closets. Two full bathrooms, a laundry room that's off the kitchen. This kitchen includes ample workspace and all stainless-steel appliances. Also, the seller is including the Wash/Dryer and Refrigerator.  We have Granite counters throughout. In the Primary Bedroom and Bath the seller has added some personal touches to make it just a little more special, such as the added glass block around the shower and the shelving. And let's not forget the living room and dining that you see when you walk through the front door. The stunning coffered ceiling cannot be ignored. This home is really move in ready... and I can say that because the seller is including all of the large pieces of furniture. Qualified buyers will learn more about that at their scheduled showing appointments. \r\nThis 55+ Community has gated and camera security with overnight patrol watch. The club houses are available for activities and events. It offers large kitchens and space for parties, plus some different game rooms. There's a fitness center, 2 hot tubs, saunas, grilling areas at the 2 separate heated pools the residents can enjoy. Within the park there is also RV storage, a car wash, an extra laundry facility, and nicely landscaped and tree lined dog walking trails. This home and community offers that lifestyle that the definition of simplicity was based on. Entry to community and home is available by appointment only.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/fee0e6baad52744a8144cffd109f93b7-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d27149f7fbc433372da9687bebd20997-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/152899ecee8981bab3862afa6077338b-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f1a12cd6926f21f03642d96441533707-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ebec649a4b9439683f10dc61e12b4a33-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"2077441398"}
