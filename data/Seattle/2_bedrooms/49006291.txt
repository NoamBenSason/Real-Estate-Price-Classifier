{"price":"$3,500,000","bed":"2","bath":"2","sqft":"1,515","address":"87 Virginia Street UNIT 11, Seattle, WA 98101","overview":"Seattle’s most iconic Pied-a-terre. Located IN Pike Place Market’s Post Alley, overlooking Victor Steinbrueck Park to Elliot Bay, the Great Wheel & Aquarium front and center with the Olympics framing Puget Sound. This design by Jim Olson of Olson Kundig won the AIA Honor Award. Unparalleled luxury living with wrap around deck makes floor to ceiling windows feel grounded. A clever layout maximizes the party and private spaces; two primary suites separated by an open living/dining room with stone tile floors, wood burning fireplace and full height windows that span the entire west face offering dramatic views from every room. Viking gas range, full height cabinets and integrated Sub-Zero kitchen. Unassuming and collectible, this condo is it.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e0570d283b1d93a0c12f84acaa169cf4-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0c4d35ee24a87c250982f0d554768a1e-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/fa8866bfcbe18e48071819b4d51f18e2-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3d30432881282a0095902e12d6a9713a-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3cae586b74bcd81531111286c5e017d0-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"49006291"}
