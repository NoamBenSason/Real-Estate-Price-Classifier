{"price":"$300,000","bed":"1","bath":"1","sqft":"450","address":"624 W Ewing Street UNIT 3,Â Seattle, WA 98119","overview":"This rustic houseboat along the Ballard canal is a pretty neat place to call home.  Say hello to Hobo. If you like originality, then you don't want to miss your chance to see this cool houseboat. Built in 1984 by Coastal Seahomes, she measures approx 30'x15' on a perro-cement hull.  Cherry wood wraps the double story interior.   If you propped the roof hatch open, you can even see the stars from your loft sleeping quarters. Fresh exterior paint above water line, a new water heater and fridge too.  A natural habit of turtles, native birds & migrating birds, beavers, and otters congregate close to shore. The Ship Canal's 1.9 bike & foot path extending from Ballard to Lake Union is steps away. Monthly fee of $750: slip, liveaboard, utilities.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5defccf7a43b351c3806bd98643ee78c-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a62c17545e0706471dce6c1050df5686-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8a92da9597c539bfe5c33cf2aba1110e-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0d417b5bd645b93ef3f1c9bb562314bc-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e35242817e531cbc19ea47f3db334862-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"2056984370"}
