{"price":"$11,999,000","bed":"5","bath":"10","sqft":"11,679","address":"1625 Federal Avenue E,Â Seattle, WA 98102","overview":"The lore of an Edwin Ivey legacy home; majestically sited on 5 city lots. Lovely formals & detailing, but most importantly, this home lives for today with a fantastic floorplan, incredible amenities & a killer indoor-outdoor flow. The kitchen (complete with a bespoke Officine Gullo cooking island) flows into the family room which opens to the outdoor patio: grill, drinks fridge, fireplace, heaters & more. Straight ahead: a florentine-inspired pool/hot tub for 8. More fun...a pickleball court & trampoline! Wine cellar you ask?  Yes, 1,250 bottles. 4 car garage & secure motor court for 10 cars?  Yes.  Indoor golf simulator? (I am not kidding you!) Home gym plus a separate apartment ~ the list goes on & on!  Nine palms...resort living at home!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d2ac7253892dc418c4fbede36182bf25-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ed7a5c2ca6eb6707105f4935b1da4a8a-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3fc225882aedecbf5841bc0582aac2bb-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/28b6dbeb96df1273bbc7ec7fab3cfb73-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7efc67309fa9a0c718649f7abd4401a1-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"48871561"}
