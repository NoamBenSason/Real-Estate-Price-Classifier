Sure to impress the most discerning buyer. Unassuming from the street, this house has been transformed for modern day living. No expense was spared when updated and continues to be meticulously maintained. Perfectly positioned on a fabled storybook street, and so close to Magnolia Village.  Magnolia Blvd is one block away where the spectacular views are a destination for Seattle visitors. Four wonderful bedrooms on one level, including a huge primary suite with vaulted ceilings, ensuite bath and peek-a-boo water views. Street to alley lot with a sunny patio and gorgeous garden. Oversized attached garage and separate side entrance allow for easy entry. Immaculate inspection report. Must see to appreciate.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ec72c58bbef779a93bbb69dc50dcfaeb-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cf1080d1327956635bcc72e0855c85ac-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7cd0751f9061877be1888561c01e7429-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e3263c7a2a743bf47efe04dd9cc83fb4-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3c44426bb3c53c819f6e8956674671d0-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"48726872"}
