Quiet, dead end street just off of 122nd but surprisingly super quiet and serene! Please review the attached inspection report and drive by home prior to scheduling a viewing. Home is being sold in as-is condition, price point is in lieu of any repairs, most likely require a rehab loan or cash purchase.
