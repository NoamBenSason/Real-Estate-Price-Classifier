{"price":"$648,790","bed":"3","bath":"2","sqft":"1,894","address":"7327 SE Stephens St,Â Portland, OR 97215","overview":"Entering this original-owner''s 1970''s split level ranch on the main floor immediately harkens back to a Brady Bunch vibe...Marcia! Marcia! Marcia! Enjoy living on Mt Tabor with easy access to the park within 2 blocks. The park was just recognized and named the nations first ''Urban Quiet Park'' by the Quiet Parks International organization. This home''s large corner lot is surrounded by a Japanese-inspired lush and mature landscape for plenty of privacy and the side yard is also ready to be used to further expand the backyard for even more entertaining and play space. There is also an adjacent public area along the lot east border for a sense of even more space. You can hike the park then come home to jump in your very own in-ground pool to cool off and relax - it''s so private you could be tempted to skinny dip! Pool is even heater-ready for either a standard furnace or solar system to be able to extend the swim season longer. The A/C and 95%+ furnace will keep you comfortable all year long. A new roof and recently rebuilt chimney gives lots of confidence this home will keep you safe and dry. There will be plenty of room for everyone with a Primary bedroom with a full bath, plus 2 more bedrooms and hall bath - all on the upper level. The rare attached 2-car garage has a convenient entry door directly down a few steps to the lower level. As part of the home''s original build the lower level has already been framed out with an area that could be a family/bonus/media room, another bedroom already with a proper egress window, the laundry room and it''s even plumbed for an additional bathroom giving added living square footage and an immediate increase in value when completed. Now it''s just waiting and ready for your own finishing touch choices. Don''t let someone else who won''t be living there make the design choices of your home. Be in control of putting your own fingerprint on this blast from the past and take it into its next chapter of life with you in the drivers seat. [Home Energy Score = 3.
