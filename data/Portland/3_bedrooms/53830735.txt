The home was filled with lady bug trinkets, tea cups, stickers... if you could put a lady bug on it, she had it! The ladybug decor no longer remains but its spirit lives on. This delightful cosmetic fixer is patiently awaiting your modern touch. Wonderfully maintained through the years. Newer water heater, furnace and AC. Lovely wood-burning fireplace in living/dining room flooded with natural light and potential hardwoods under carpet. Primary suite on the main offers accessible living. Two bedrooms upstairs share a bath and each have their own vanity. Partially finished basement with high ceilings and separate entrance could be converted to ADU. Buyer to do their due diligence. Eat raspberries from the immaculate yard and enjoy the rhododendrons while you love on the interior of this charming home. Mature trees line the street, which is perfect for a summertime exploration or a bike ride. Easy accessibility to all parts of the city. Enjoy all that Clinton and Division Streets have to offer such a short distance from your new home! Walker''s paradise score of 93 and biker''s paradise score of 95! [Home Energy Score = 3.
