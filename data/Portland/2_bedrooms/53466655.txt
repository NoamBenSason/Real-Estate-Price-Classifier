Roomy and spacious with warm hardwoods throughout, an excellent color scheme and an eye for design is what you will find in this gem.  Live comfortably and move freely in this inviting atmosphere, whether you choose to be indoors or out!  The main house has 2 generously sized bedrooms/1 bathroom, a large storage/utility room, an attached garage and a great basement with high ceilings, laundry and workshop area.  Plenty of room for you AND all your gear.  Outside the lovely living spaces continue on the covered patio....or the uncovered flagstone patio and the gorgeous mature landscaping. The secondary residence is a quintessential tiny home clad in wood siding and it packs a big punch.  At 216 SQFT it is complete with a sleeping area (or two!), work area, kitchenette, and bathroom.  It has both vaulted ceilings and a private deck.  Endless opportunities here, just take  your pick.  Rounding out this fabulous package is a radon mitigation system and a new roof and exterior paint within the last several years.  Raised beds on the side of the house are producing strawberries, grapes and lettuce.   The allure of this property is hard to beat and presents a unique opportunity to create your new home.
