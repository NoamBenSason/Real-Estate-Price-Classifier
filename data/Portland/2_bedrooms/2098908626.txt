A beautiful 2016 floating home with boat slip attached to deck and highly preferred concrete/steel frame float at the desirable, gated Larson/s Moorage is now available! Larson's Moorage is at the hub of the three major waterways in the area. It is 2 minutes to the Willamette River, 7 minutes to the Columbia River and 8 miles to downtown Portland by boat. Salmon fishing is practically right outside your door. It's just minutes from the Sauvie Island bridge for farmers markets,beaches, and farm-to-table events and concerts or enjoy a hike or bike ride at Forest Park right in your backyard. There is abundant sunshine due to the large view windows and doors that lead to the large and private cedar deck. It is an inside slip, but is surrounded by generous water areas, foliage, and wildlife. Sit on the front deck and enjoy the view of the Multnomah Channel. The house is well maintained inside and out with an open floor plan. It's bright and airy.  Investors should note that this property is outside of the service boundary of the city of Portland where rental regulations may differ from what they are inside of the service boundary.  This was a private home for 4 years and then started being leased in 2019, during which time the home has been well maintained.  The lease will end during the first week of July.  It can continue to be used as a profitable rental property or return to an owner-occupied residence. It's very affordable with low monthly costs. This is an extremely nice home for the price. The second bedroom is non-conforming.
