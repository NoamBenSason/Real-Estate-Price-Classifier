{"price":"$337,000","bed":"2","bath":"1","sqft":"792","address":"25000 NW Saint Helens Rd UNIT N-3,Â Portland, OR 97231","overview":"Built in 2018, this contemporary home is beautiful, bright and airy. It comes with a boat slip on the north edge of the house!!!  It can be bought furnished! The floating home slip rent is relatively low at $565 per month. The open floor plan, vaulted ceilings, and plenty of windows welcome natural light and scenic views. The loft is used as a non-conforming second bedroom which could be used as an office. The kitchen is modern and has quartz countertops and stainless appliances. The living room has sliding glass door that opens onto a spacious covered deck. This home is near the end of the dock, so there are only a handful of neighboring houses. This is a great spot across from Sauvie Island and is a very enjoyable part of the river for paddling. Summertime on the water is calling!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6ede57b710d7ba316169744e84650505-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ecea53e9cd6a72a6a0787e96997c2dde-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://www.zillowstatic.com/floor_map/e5acc06d-2fe8-81b0-0d7d-2eac1330f514/hero.png","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c2758df8a05496f2959279d2acbe700a-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b8a1458187af87e2d7901b4c081271e3-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"2066350136"}
