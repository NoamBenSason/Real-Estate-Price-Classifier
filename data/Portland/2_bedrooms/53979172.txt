{"price":"$595,000","bed":"2","bath":"1","sqft":"708","address":"1803 NE 114th Ave,Â Portland, OR 97220","overview":"Great development opportunity! The company \"Faster Permits\" has done the research with the city and come up with the 4 possible different development plans that are in the pictures and in the attachments.  The existing home is cute as a button and move-in ready! The new kitchen has tile floors, tile counters, new appliances, new cabinets, and it looks into the living room area that has a slider out to a covered patio and huge, fenced back yard. There is a two-car garage with a workbench and two garage doors with openers.  What a great location for a great investment!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/29d54934d6e2df521792e28d0446c1f3-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f9c7d239762a70278103c2fd22dcdb82-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8e2470f6271f959e7466fd9422426015-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/83244e134e22fb2e5a2d22359a049f0c-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4815e051360e467e15b0b254c85a9568-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"53979172"}
