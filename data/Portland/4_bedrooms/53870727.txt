{"price":"$638,999","bed":"4","bath":"3","sqft":"3,452","address":"15121 NE Clackamas St,Â Portland, OR 97230","overview":"I have seen homes in Laurel Hurst and Alameda which have sold for over a million dollars that do not have the charm and character this home boasts. I love to walk out the French doors to this private escape to mature with a charming rock walking path which leads you to the in-ground pool. Since this was one of the few homes in this area with a large lot, .37 to be exact, it would have been the party home for young and old alike. The sheer size of the back yard allows for not only an inground pool but also huge fir trees and amazing landscaping. You would think this would fill a normal backyard with nothing to spare. If you did you would be wrong. Today we would be playing Bochy ball in the spacious yard but back then in the 60? s it would have been croquet. The spacious kitchen is light and bright with more cabinet space than you may find in a commercial kitchen. If you have a large family or just need space for a table to handle 12+ people, this is the home for you. The dining room is massive! This home has been amazingly restored to its original condition, which includes the counter tops, sinks and bathroom with traditional colors and fixtures which speak of a simpler time when days were spent listening to jazz on the weekends and meeting at the local malt shop was a must on a Saturday night. This home would have been the hot spot for kids in the 50? s. Most weekends back then involved sleepovers with large groups of kids which would dance the night away listening to Elvis and The Everly brothers. The large basement with its wet bar and tile floors would have made for the perfect dance floor since sock hops were the rage, and a smooth tile floor was just what the doctor ordered. I imagine the large wood fireplace made for an easy lead into that first romantic kiss with the gentle sounds of the amazing Ray Charles drifting through the air. If you are looking for character and a bargain price, this is the one for you.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/82fc77fe4d9d0328dd6c7fa10edc5627-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/114d81583719f117e368bd17242c7a30-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/897b61a7086b9c9c370ea85cc2e8c22f-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/406fcf4995abab99cc5758ffd4a76aa2-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9a864c810a03c54ec14d74cc8291c319-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"53870727"}
