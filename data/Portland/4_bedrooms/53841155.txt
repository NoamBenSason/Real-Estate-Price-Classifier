This home has all the features, walkability, and all the amenities you could want. The maintenance and attention to detail is clearly seen throughout. Wood built-ins are in multiple rooms as well as solid wood flooring and doors. Arch doorways and wood encasements as well as art/picture railing are just a few of the eye catching finishes. Each floor has a full bathroom, and the upstairs is a true 2nd floor (not a converted attic). The full basement features a family room, full bathroom, kitchenette, laundry room, and workshop (potential for ADU/separate living). The backyard with a new fence is private and perfect for entertaining. Alongside the backyard is a long driveway leading to the detached garage.  All of the landscaping throughout the property is established and absolutely gorgeous. [Home Energy Score = 2.
