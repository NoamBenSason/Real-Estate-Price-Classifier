{"price":"$4,950,000","bed":"5","bath":"5","sqft":"6,178","address":"4230 SW Council Crest Dr,Â Portland, OR 97239","overview":"This mid-century modern residence was designed by global award-winning architecture firm, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, whose fame extends to flagship Apple stores around the world. The house, known as the View Master house, not only for the visually SPECTACULAR vistas of the Pacific Northwest, but also in honor of the original commissioning owner, who was chief design engineer of the iconic View Master viewer. From the very beginning, this home was awash in creativity. The original owner hired acclaimed architect Roscoe Hemenway to create a modern dwelling that captured the endless views & brought modern to life inside the home.  In 2006 the home passed to another creative force, when a Nike marketing executive and his family purchased the home. In 2011, this stunning spot on Council Crest was re-imagined & remodeled when the current owners placed the well-preserved masterpiece into the hands Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. From inside the home and from outside on terraced decks, one can gaze, over evergreens, across downtown Portland, to the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers and beyond to majestic Cascade Mountains including Mount Hood, St Helens, Adams, and Rainer. Materials include local basalt, Ipe wood decks, walnut paneling, book shelves, custom cabinets, Ann Sachs tile, and Hans Grohe fixtures, among other exceptional details. This spacious 5 bedroom house has 3 en-suites, one on each of the three levels. Glass completely encompasses the primary suite which occupies the entire second level, also hosting a lounge area with its own private deck. The list is long, if you are counting amenities, but this house is truly more, than the sum of its parts.  The home is refined & defined- it stands for, more of a way of living and of thinking. Its design is sleek and clean, minimal in places to inform a maximum definition of space, both interior and exterior, separated sometimes, by only glass, or solidly behind stone. Live peacefully in rhythm and balance.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7b3d46d5de6fb713136eb4d6fad64168-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/030759a9143ab2a63d3690ab33cc6cee-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6d6755c59e7a363de2099d86a412735a-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d0b8ab4c395f4ef81648fec3bac3aa62-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5b60567bd376cee666736c1ab6c5d3ad-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"53877727"}
