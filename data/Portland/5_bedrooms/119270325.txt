Take for example, items on your wish list that include a newly built home with plenty of room to allow for the separation of activities and lifestyle, and being in a good neighborhood! This home really does check a lot of boxes, including one of the best public school districts in all of Portland Public Schools, Ainsworth Elementary. How many times have we all wished to live on a quiet dead-end street away from cars bustling around to and from their destinations? Well, that can be checked off too, a home that sits proudly on a dead-end street and yet is still close enough to neighborhood access so that you don't feel isolated. A good-sized yard, a long driveway, and plenty of deck space offer outdoor access to stretch and play or get in a game of horse with the attached basketball hoop. Take a moment to look closely at what this home has to offer: A newer 2015 construction that translates into low-maintenance systems. Modern design and amenities give you updated aesthetics and style. Ample room within the 4589 square foot home, providing bedrooms, common rooms, private suites, bonus spaces, and places to gather as one. Of course, the location is A+ and is close to restaurants, shopping, freeway access, and only a few blocks to schools. Looking for the complete package that you want to make your own? Then look no further than 2635 SW Grenwolde Pl, and make this your home. [Home Energy Score = 3.
