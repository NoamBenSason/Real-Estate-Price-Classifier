{"price":"$198,000","bed":"1","bath":"1","sqft":"600","address":"1717 N Jantzen Ave,Â Portland, OR 97217","overview":"Could be adorable, bring your contractor and imagination. Talk about potential, 1 bed 1 bath floating home, PLUS tender and separate swim float. This home unfortunately had an interior fire that started near the hot water heater. It appears to be rebuildable and limited to a small area of the home between the kitchen and bedroom. This home offers one of the best slips in the moorage, facing out towards the river with an unobstructed view to the opposite shore line. Easy tie up, bring your boat or jet skis, better yet bring them both! As previously mentioned, this home also has a tender house which currently has the washer/dryer located in it. This space lends itself very nicely to a home office, studio, work out room, etc. Low HOA fees include water, sewer, and garbage. Jantzen Beach Moorage offers secure gated parking, night time security guard and on site maintenance for the common grounds. Seller makes no claims of habitability, utility services, or warranties of any nature due to the unknown damage to the structure. Buyers are encouraged to have the home professionally inspected.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/de2ac0bbe2583aead3d4f1ceee7b2d97-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b1294fb9700f23e04e762706c45a8c29-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c277da83685e0877584e012986fc605f-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1aed39fbfb282d06368b7846a51208be-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9c762283b79801cc0e0e7ea9daa47203-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"2057088030"}
