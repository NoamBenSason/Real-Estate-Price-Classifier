The cool, moist ocean air keeps temps comfortable & this unique home, its configuration & the surrounding tourist features will make you feel like you're perpetually on holiday. Carroll Parks' circular road harkens back to a bygone era of the horse & buggy with the homes surrounding the green park being a necklace of vintage jewels. Mostly true to its architectural origins w/ authentic hardware on the solid oak front door sets the stage for the details to come. Original oak floors flow seamlessly from sitting room, dining room & parlor. Brazilian Koa hardwood adorns the Primary suite, hall and the second story. Custom stained glass punctuates many of the doors & windows transforming them from functional to artistic. Some windows have been replaced & meet historic standards of the area; double paned, double hung sash & casement style keeps street sounds muffled & temps controlled. Solid oak kitchen cabinets are anchored by Verde Matisse counters w/ a European edge & the custom, deep cast, country sink is embellished w/ an acanthus leaf motif. Stainless appliances encircle the Celtic knot medallion floor motif of four dragons; the ancient protectors of the earth & life. Improved insulation maximizes the air delivered from the Mitsubishi zonal heating & cooling; keeping the home comfortable both upstairs & down w/ energy efficiency.  All copper re-piping keeps the Noritz Tank-less water heater sated and the Mansfield whirlpool Deep Bathing-Well filled & ready to massage away stress.
