ORIGINAL OWNERS that have taken great care of this home!  Built by Ben Batey.  They have done updates over the years in kitchen: granite counters and painted cabinets, primary bath remodel, AC, Roof, and flooring. Not to mention this location is wonderful on a semi-cul-de-sac, near shopping, schools, golf course, and much more.  You will really enjoy the backyard patio that flows into a beautifully landscaped back yard.  It''s just waiting for you!","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2c9986420de3df186672bec471847f23-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9578e912fed1ef78c9c91ec9189c26ac-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f894fdb21157ce3558bff76aaf4823b3-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/44d9136fe5c4c0fc8d3087bfae04a4d0-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8e85f7474a87e0fa307a3615e144348a-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"18984206"}
