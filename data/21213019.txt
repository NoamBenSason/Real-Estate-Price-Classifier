The refurbishment was undertaken with great care in order to maintain Lloyd’s original vision. The home boasts some of the most incredible views and eye lines available in Long Beach, and Park Estates. From the living areas to the bedrooms, to the massive windows that almost bring the local greenery inside with you. Lloyd influenced by his father Frank Lloyd Wright, was sure to use unique building materials to ensure that the home, while separated from nature, does not clash with it. A double sided brick fireplace rises like a tree out of the original hardwood floors. The primary bedroom is nestled in the corner of the back yard so you can see across the entire back garden. The kitchen provides you a view down the lovely curving street. Lloyd made sure that no matter where you are in the house, there is always a foreground, mid-ground, and background. These are just a few of the amazing aspects of a design that needs to be seen rather than read about.  While all of that design is amazing to look at, the house begs to be lived in. The refurbishment included an enormous list of custom projects. These range from all new custom facades (notched exactly like the originals), new custom doors (also designed alike the originals), custom hardwood floor refinishing, custom side panels, and many more. In addition to rehabbing Lloyd’s original designs, there is also a new; roof, foundation and reinforced, copper plumbing, electrical, appliances, glass windows and railings throughout, kitchen counters, LED lighting with smart switches, smart thermostat, air conditioner, forced air heat and ducting, bathroom tile, tubs, showers, front deck, EV charging outlets, wood fencing, and much more. The renovations also included remodeling the basement to create 780 square feet of new living space, all matching Lloyd’s original style and feel. This architectural wonder is ready to be lived in now. The timeless designs of Lloyd Wright combined with a complete modernization, entrusts this home with all of the classic architectural style of Lloyd Wright's architectural design, merged with all 2023 code requirements.","images":["https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8285838cffbbc9a6c3e24262914468a8-cc_ft_960.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e512dae612163c4020665a023a896db1-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2dd7a1faf93325a2a96b1f409f7ec1ef-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1dfb83de2bb19be78690a769c97dd0a6-cc_ft_576.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5ef39ca0f6a5f59a974bfb5795aa8c3e-cc_ft_576.jpg"],"zpid":"21213019"}
