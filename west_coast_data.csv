Completely refurbished in 2022 & 23.This Lloyd Wright is a sublime midcentury modern home. Lloyd began his architectural design work on the original home in 1953 and finished in 1954 per his authentic Lloyd Wright Book. The refurbishment was undertaken with great care in order to maintain Lloyd’s original vision. The home boasts some of the most incredible views and eye lines available in Long Beach, and Park Estates. From the living areas to the bedrooms, to the massive windows that almost bring the local greenery inside with you. Lloyd influenced by his father Frank Lloyd Wright, was sure to use unique building materials to ensure that the home, while separated from nature, does not clash with it. A double sided brick fireplace rises like a tree out of the original hardwood floors. The primary bedroom is nestled in the corner of the back yard so you can see across the entire back garden. The kitchen provides you a view down the lovely curving street. Lloyd made sure that no matter where you are in the house, there is always a foreground, mid-ground, and background. These are just a few of the amazing aspects of a design that needs to be seen rather than read about.  While all of that design is amazing to look at, the house begs to be lived in. The refurbishment included an enormous list of custom projects. These range from all new custom facades (notched exactly like the originals), new custom doors (also designed alike the originals), custom hardwood floor refinishing, custom side panels, and many more. In addition to rehabbing Lloyd’s original designs, there is also a new; roof, foundation and reinforced, copper plumbing, electrical, appliances, glass windows and railings throughout, kitchen counters, LED lighting with smart switches, smart thermostat, air conditioner, forced air heat and ducting, bathroom tile, tubs, showers, front deck, EV charging outlets, wood fencing, and much more. The renovations also included remodeling the basement to create 780 square feet of new living space, all matching Lloyd’s original style and feel.

53870727,4,3.0,3452.0,NE Clackamas St,Portland,OR,"I have seen homes in Laurel Hurst and Alameda which have sold for over a million dollars that do not have the charm and character this home boasts. I love to walk out the French doors to this private escape to mature with a charming rock walking path which leads you to the in-ground pool. Since this was one of the few homes in this area with a large lot, .37 to be exact, it would have been the party home for young and old alike. The sheer size of the back yard allows for not only an inground pool but also huge fir trees and amazing landscaping. You would think this would fill a normal backyard with nothing to spare. If you did you would be wrong. Today we would be playing Bochy ball in the spacious yard but back then in the 60? s it would have been croquet. The spacious kitchen is light and bright with more cabinet space than you may find in a commercial kitchen. If you have a large family or just need space for a table to handle 12+ people, this is the home for you. The dining room is massive! This home has been amazingly restored to its original condition, which includes the counter tops, sinks and bathroom with traditional colors and fixtures which speak of a simpler time when days were spent listening to jazz on the weekends and meeting at the local malt shop was a must on a Saturday night. This home would have been the hot spot for kids in the 50? s. Most weekends back then involved sleepovers with large groups of kids which would dance the night away listening to Elvis and The Everly brothers. The large basement with its wet bar and tile floors would have made for the perfect dance floor since sock hops were the rage, and a smooth tile floor was just what the doctor ordered. I imagine the large wood fireplace made for an easy lead into that first romantic kiss with the gentle sounds of the amazing Ray Charles drifting through the air.

The house, known as the View Master house, not only for the visually SPECTACULAR vistas of the Pacific Northwest, but also in honor of the original commissioning owner, who was chief design engineer of the iconic View Master viewer. From the very beginning, this home was awash in creativity. The original owner hired acclaimed architect Roscoe Hemenway to create a modern dwelling that captured the endless views & brought modern to life inside the home.  In 2006 the home passed to another creative force, when a Nike marketing executive and his family purchased the home. In 2011, this stunning spot on Council Crest was re-imagined & remodeled when the current owners placed the well-preserved masterpiece into the hands Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. From inside the home and from outside on terraced decks, one can gaze, over evergreens, across downtown Portland, to the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers and beyond to majestic Cascade Mountains including Mount Hood, St Helens, Adams, and Rainer. Materials include local basalt, Ipe wood decks, walnut paneling, book shelves, custom cabinets, Ann Sachs tile, and Hans Grohe fixtures, among other exceptional details. This spacious 5 bedroom house has 3 en-suites, one on each of the three levels. Glass completely encompasses the primary suite which occupies the entire second level, also hosting a lounge area with its own private deck.
