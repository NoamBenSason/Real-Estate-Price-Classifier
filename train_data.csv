Completely refurbished in 2022 & 23.This Lloyd Wright is a sublime midcentury modern home. Lloyd began his architectural design work on the original home in 1953 and finished in 1954 per his authentic Lloyd Wright Book. The refurbishment was undertaken with great care in order to maintain Lloyd’s original vision. The home boasts some of the most incredible views and eye lines available in Long Beach, and Park Estates. From the living areas to the bedrooms, to the massive windows that almost bring the local greenery inside with you. Lloyd influenced by his father Frank Lloyd Wright, was sure to use unique building materials to ensure that the home, while separated from nature, does not clash with it. A double sided brick fireplace rises like a tree out of the original hardwood floors. The primary bedroom is nestled in the corner of the back yard so you can see across the entire back garden. The kitchen provides you a view down the lovely curving street. Lloyd made sure that no matter where you are in the house, there is always a foreground, mid-ground, and background. These are just a few of the amazing aspects of a design that needs to be seen rather than read about.  While all of that design is amazing to look at, the house begs to be lived in. The refurbishment included an enormous list of custom projects. These range from all new custom facades (notched exactly like the originals), new custom doors (also designed alike the originals), custom hardwood floor refinishing, custom side panels, and many more. In addition to rehabbing Lloyd’s original designs, there is also a new; roof, foundation and reinforced, copper plumbing, electrical, appliances, glass windows and railings throughout, kitchen counters, LED lighting with smart switches, smart thermostat, air conditioner, forced air heat and ducting, bathroom tile, tubs, showers, front deck, EV charging outlets, wood fencing, and much more. The renovations also included remodeling the basement to create 780 square feet of new living space, all matching Lloyd’s original style and feel. This architectural wonder is ready to be lived in now. The timeless designs of Lloyd Wright combined with a complete modernization, entrusts this home with all of the classic architectural style of Lloyd Wright's architectural design, merged with all 2023 code requirements.",https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8285838cffbbc9a6c3e24262914468a8-cc_ft_960.jpg,2.85

The house, known as the View Master house, not only for the visually SPECTACULAR vistas of the Pacific Northwest, but also in honor of the original commissioning owner, who was chief design engineer of the iconic View Master viewer. From the very beginning, this home was awash in creativity. The original owner hired acclaimed architect Roscoe Hemenway to create a modern dwelling that captured the endless views & brought modern to life inside the home.  In 2006 the home passed to another creative force, when a Nike marketing executive and his family purchased the home. In 2011, this stunning spot on Council Crest was re-imagined & remodeled when the current owners placed the well-preserved masterpiece into the hands Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. From inside the home and from outside on terraced decks, one can gaze, over evergreens, across downtown Portland, to the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers and beyond to majestic Cascade Mountains including Mount Hood, St Helens, Adams, and Rainer. Materials include local basalt, Ipe wood decks, walnut paneling, book shelves, custom cabinets, Ann Sachs tile, and Hans Grohe fixtures, among other exceptional details. This spacious 5 bedroom house has 3 en-suites, one on each of the three levels. Glass completely encompasses the primary suite which occupies the entire second level, also hosting a lounge area with its own private deck.

Most weekends back then involved sleepovers with large groups of kids which would dance the night away listening to Elvis and The Everly brothers. The large basement with its wet bar and tile floors would have made for the perfect dance floor since sock hops were the rage, and a smooth tile floor was just what the doctor ordered.
