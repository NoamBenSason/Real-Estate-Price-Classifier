This Queen Anne Victorian twin in developing West Germantown is a rare example of an untouched original charm. A long and private green front yard sets this privately off the quiet tree-filled side street with a gated front entry. The wrap around porch has a side entry as well as double doors that open straight off the parlor. Walking through the front door puts you in the entry hall with the original staircase and banister as well as a diamond window into a wainscotted pantry closet--the first instance of probable yellow pine that appears throughout the home. The front parlor has a wood-burning fireplace, a bank of three windows and the double door entry to the porch. Continuing to the rear of the house places you in the dining room with a chair rail molding. Behind that used to sit the kitchen that has an entry to servant stairs and the basement, as well as access to the rear former laundry room/pantry that would be a natural place to add a second full bath or a half bath. Access is here to the rear yard. Upstairs, you'll find six bedrooms. In this style of home, the front two bedrooms on each floor are massive and the second floor bedroom has an impressive second fireplace with a mirror built into the mantel. On this floor, the full bath is located. There is space right above it on the third floor to add another full bath to that floor, perhaps expanding it into a primary suite. The servant staircase does something unique--it has a stained glass window at the top that is accessible off a small landing out a rear bedroom door. A built-in gate sits at the top of the servant stairs. The third floor has working transom windows. One of the bedrooms here was used as a crafting studio and has floor paper down over the original pine. The basement holds the mechanicals--to the best of our knowledge, the furnace is on the newer side as well as the water heater. A newer condenser is outside. It is believed to be oil heat.

2056958324,8.0,5.0,11360.0,W Chestnut Hill Ave,Philadelphia,PA,"Once in a generation opportunity to own one of the most significant properties in Philadelphia.  Named ""Binderton"" by its first owner J. Wilmer Biddle, and  designed by Cope & Stewardson Architects (also designed for University of Pennsylvania and Princeton), the house was started in 1903 and finished in 1906.   The renowned landscape architecture  firm of the Olmsted Brothers was engaged to handle landscape, hardscape, and garden design.  During their ownership, the present owners purchased 461 W Chestnut Hill Ave. (which had been subdivided from the original plot many years earlier)  demolished the modest house that existed , and expanded the property and gardens, and  redesigned the driveway.  Situated on the quietest street in Chestnut Hill and surrounded by homes of equal caliber, Binderton stands out with its brilliant red brick construction and distinctive Jacobean Revival (or Jacobethan) style , with shaped parapets, and intricately designed chimneys.   In most places, the house is designed only one room deep and was built linearly, near the property line at the high side.  The front yard slightly slopes toward Towanda Street. The brilliance of the Olmsted Brothers work is apparent in the brick walkway  that rises elegantly from Towanda Street up a gradual hill with a low step every 20 feet or so.    From the stone patio, enter the front door  into the formal entry hall with main staircase at the back. The foyer is filled with natural light from two sides, a fireplace, a  powder room, and a large coat room with window.  Again from the  entry hall, walk into, what was  called in 1906,  the ""Ladies'' Parlor"", a sunny, elegant sitting room with big windows and a fireplace.   The formal living room with two distinct seating areas, beamed ceiling , and wood burning fireplace can be accessed from the ""ladies'' parlor"" or directly from a hallway with window seat for a  tete-a-tete.  The exterior door off the living room leads to a spacious loggia with beautifully tiled floor and finished ceiling.  To the left of the front door, head to  the formal dining room with fireplace, elegant crystal chandelier and room for  a second dining table!  The kitchen end of the house is more than you have imagined.  From the front hall,  head through the butler''s pantry with lighted cabinetry,  porcelain sink , and dishwasher: a  great spot to set up the bar on party nights.  Further on you reach the supersized chef''s kitchen with two sinks, three ovens, a six-burner range, banquette seating for conversation while prepping dinner,  stools at the counter for breakfasts on a busy day, and a big table at the end of the house  for casual dinners. Off the kitchen is a huge pantry area and laundry room with an extra fridge and another sink.  At the kitchen end of the house is a glassed in garden porch that will serve myriad functions that make daily living more convenient.  Head up the carved and turned staircase and turn left at the top to reach the primary suite.  This sweet space includes the bedroom with fireplace and door to second floor balcony, a cozy sitting room, great for reading or streaming late into the night, a beautiful, bright corner office/den, and a spacious bathroom with two sinks and walk-in shower.  On the second floor to the right of the main stair are four additional bedrooms, two of which share a jack-and-jill bath ; and two others that share an additional hall bath.   The third floor has three  bedrooms, a full bath, and a large central room, perfect for play or privacy.   The 1.6 acres that surround the house defy description.  Mature trees, abundant perennial beds, lush lawns, and garden rooms; one prettier than the next.  The main focus in the summer is the pool area. Exquisitely private with its walled garden, and elegant brick pool house, it is here where you can escape from the sun and the world.    Built to span the ages,  Binderton will pass to someone who loves grand old  houses and understands stewardship.",https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cec40e7f4a9ffdb93650175a09f4d064-cc_ft_960.jpg https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/df10c5a7b19886af99700ba7a9465866-cc_ft_576.jpg https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/febd0f5167454ef806c4e29562b5479a-cc_ft_576.jpg https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/200e692f38daed5d38c9233df431392d-cc_ft_576.jpg https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a06597a66612b7007f8072f1ce67cd33-cc_ft_576.jpg,3.25

The kitchen features stainless steel cabinets and appliances, black granite counter tops, and a custom-built island topped with a gorgeous slab of old-growth heart of yellow pine. Adjacent to the kitchen is a dining area with a custom industrial gear chandelier and plenty of room for seating 8-10 guests. Though the open plan gives you countless configurations, currently the living room centers on a hologram, electric fireplace (functional heat source) accentuated by a handsome salvaged mantle, four carved corbels, and surrounded by 216 handmade tiles. This fireplace, the adjacent complementing shelves, and eight one-of-a-kind lighting fixtures are examples of the many custom-built details you will find throughout the loft. The primary bedroom is spacious, easily fitting a king sized bed and large closet, and is nicely secluded from the light-filled main room using a clever book shelf and window partition. This bedroom adjoins an en-suite bath with double vanity, bath/shower combo, a laundry closet (brand new, full-sized, washer and dryer), and is set off by a tin ceiling adding style while also giving the unit a crawl space in which to easily access and “hide” mechanicals.
